I'm an evolutionary biologist interested in developing and applying statistical genetic methods.
Most of my work focuses on Bayesian inference methods on the interface between population genetics and phylogenetics.
I completed my PhD at the University of California, Davis under the supervision of Bruce Rannala.
Now, I'm a postdoc with Michael Landis at Washington University in St.Louis.
