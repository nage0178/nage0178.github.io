I have worked on several large software projects such as [bpp](https://github.com/bpp/bpp) and developed [HIVtree](https://github.com/nage0178/HIVtree) by modifying mcmctree from [PAML](https://github.com/abacus-gene/paml).
I have written independent software including [MutAnce](https://github.com/nage0178/MutAnce). 
I mostly program in C. 
See more of my projects on my [github](https://github.com/nage0178).
